# Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false 
# otherwise. 
# 
#  A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original 
# string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the 
# relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of 
# "abcde" while "aec" is not). 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: true
#  
#  Example 2: 
#  Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: false
#  
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  0 <= s.length <= 100 
#  0 <= t.length <= 10‚Å¥ 
#  s and t consist only of lowercase English letters. 
#  
# 
#  
# Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming 
# s, say 
# s1, s2, ..., sk where 
# k >= 10‚Åπ, and you want to check one by one to see if 
# t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
